# RichTextEditorExample
A sample project to demonstrate creating a rich text editor that formats a list of tags. The sample app allows you to change a comma delimited list of tags alongside the actual text, and the text is tagged appropriately.

## Motivation
I'm working on a project that requires me to create a tag editor that highlights tags as the user types. This example isn't nearly as polished as my final product will be, however the parsing and formatting logic could be beneficial to someone also looking for this behavior.
